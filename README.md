***The training arc for multi-agent orchestration.***

Walk in not knowing how to coordinate AI agents. Walk out building systems that run autonomously. The Hyperbolic Time Chamber.

`🌀 Materializing...`

## What This Will Be

A 12-week structured program that takes you from zero to running your own multi-agent system. Not theory. Not slides. You build the thing while you learn the thing.

### The Arc

| Week | Belt | What You Learn |
|------|------|----------------|
| 1-2 | ⬜ White | First agent setup. Memory, personality, basic commands. Your agent says hello. |
| 3-4 | 🟨 Yellow | File-based memory. Your agent remembers yesterday. Daily logs, context loading. |
| 5-6 | 🟧 Orange | Cron jobs, heartbeats, proactive behavior. Your agent works while you sleep. |
| 7-8 | 🟩 Green | Second agent. Agent-to-agent communication. They talk to each other. |
| 9-10 | 🟦 Blue | Orchestration. One agent dispatches work to others. Sub-agents, task routing. |
| 11-12 | 🟪 Purple | Multi-machine. Gateway configs, SSH sync, always-on infrastructure. |
| 🖤 | Black Belt | Your system runs 24/7 without you touching it. You built the Shadow Dominion equivalent. |

### Who This Is For

- Developers who want AI agents that actually DO things (not chatbots)
- Anyone curious about multi-agent orchestration but overwhelmed by where to start
- People who learn by building, not by reading documentation

### What You Need

- A terminal
- An AI provider API key (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.)
- [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) (free, open source)
- 2-4 hours per week

## Philosophy

Most "AI agent" tutorials show you a chatbot and call it a day. The Dojo is different.

By Week 4, your agent has memory. By Week 8, you have two agents coordinating work. By Week 12, you have infrastructure that runs autonomously across machines.

Every lesson ends with something working. No dead theory. No "imagine if." You build it, it runs, you move to the next belt.
